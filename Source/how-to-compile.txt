Due to the performance issues it is recommended to use MinGW even under Windows.

Under Windows the code can be compiled using the following commands (make sure you are using 64-bit MinGW):

g++ -D BUILD_DLL -Ofast -c -o slp.o slp.cpp -fopenmp
g++ -static -static-libgcc -static-libstdc++ -shared -o slp.dll -Wl, slp.o -fopenmp

Alternatively, MS Visual Studio can be used in the usual way.
