# sparse_label_propagation


Here I present the implementation of the Sparse Label Propagation (SLP) algorithm (https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.01414).
The algorithm unleashes power of the semi-supervised machine learning methods and allows for graph signal recovery only from few (sparse) signal observations.
